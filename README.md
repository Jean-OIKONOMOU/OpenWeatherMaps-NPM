# HOW DO I INSTALL THIS AMAZING NPM MODULE ?
```console
npm install -g jadm
```

# HOW DO I CALL THIS AMAZING MODULE ?
In the console type **jadm** followed by your city.
For example:
```console
jadm brussels
```

# WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THE 'PWNED API' LIKE THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID ?
We can't use that API from within the BeCode network. I used the OpenWeatherMaps API instead.

# WHAT PACKETS DID YOU USE ?
I used a couple of interesting NPM modules :
- `chalk` for all those ugly colors.
- `figlet` for transforming the name of your city into an ASCII abomination.
- `Commander` for enabling the **city** argument.
- `Axios` to make API calls like a boss.
- `co` and `co-prompt` for querying the user about a **username** and **password** part (poppy / poppy).

# WHO IS POPPY, AND WHY SHOULD I CARE ?
I was just fooling around with the code. I wanted to see how you could protect the access to the package with a username / password. Just write **poppy** for the username, and **poppy** for the password.

# CREDITS
Me, myself, and I.
